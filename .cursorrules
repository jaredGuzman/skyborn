You are an expert in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Astro framework for scalable web development.Key Principles- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Astro examples.
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration and multi-framework support effectively
- Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Astro's naming conventions.
- Organize files using Astro's file-based routing system.Astro Project Structure
- Use the recommended Astro project structure:
    - src/
    - components/ 
    - layouts/ 
    - pages/ 
    - styles/
    - public/
    - astro.config.mjs

Component Development
- Create .astro files for Astro components.
- Use framework-specific components (React, Vue, Svelte) when necessary.
- Implement proper component composition and reusability.
- Use Astro's component props for data passing.
- Leverage Astro's built-in components like  when appropriate.

Routing and Pages
- Utilize Astro's file-based routing system in the src/pages/ directory.
- Implement dynamic routes using [...slug].astro syntax.
- Use getStaticPaths() for generating static pages with dynamic routes.
- Implement proper 404 handling with a 404.astro page.

Content Management
- Use Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) files for content-heavy pages.
- Leverage Astro's built-in support for frontmatter in Markdown files.
- Implement content collections for organized content management.

Styling
- Use Astro's scoped styling with  tags in .astro files.
- Leverage global styles when necessary, importing them in layouts.
- Utilize CSS preprocessing with scss if required.
- Implement responsive design using CSS custom properties and media queries.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage Astro's static generation
- Use the client:* directives judiciously for partial hydration:
    - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
    - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
    - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
- Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
- Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features.

Data Fetching
- Use Astro.props for passing data to components.
- Implement getStaticPaths() for fetching data at build time.
- Use Astro.glob() for working with local files efficiently.
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations.

SEO and Meta Tags
- Use Astro's <head> tag for adding meta information.
- Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
- Use the <SEO> component pattern for reusable SEO setups.

Integrations and Plugins
- Utilize Astro integrations for extending functionality (e.g., @astrojs/image).
- Implement proper configuration for integrations in astro.config.mjs.
- Use Astro's official integrations when available for better compatibility.


Build and Deployment
- Optimize the build process using Astro's build command.
- Implement proper environment variable handling for different environments.

Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Integrate Tailwind CSS with Astro @astrojs/tailwind

Tailwind CSS Best Practices
- Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your Astro components.
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
- Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale for consistency.
- Implement custom theme extensions in tailwind.config.cjs when necessary.
- Never use the @apply directive

Testing- Implement unit tests for utility functions and helpers.
- Use end-to-end testing tools like Cypress for testing the built site.
- Implement visual regression testing if applicable.

Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Astro components.
- Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.

Key Conventions
1. Follow Astro's Style Guide for consistent code formatting.
2. Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.
3. Implement proper error handling and logging.
4. Leverage Astro's RSS feed generation for content-heavy sites.
5. Use Astro's Image component for optimized image delivery.

Performance Metrics
- Prioritize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in development.
- Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance auditing.
- Implement performance budgets and monitoring.

Refer to Astro's official documentation for detailed information on components, routing, and integrations for best practices.

# Cursor Rules Location

Rules for placing and organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

<rule>
name: cursor_rules_location
description: Standards for placing Cursor rule files in the correct directory
filters:
  # Match any .mdc files
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.mdc$"
  # Match files that look like Cursor rules
  - type: content
    pattern: "(?s)<rule>.*?</rule>"
  # Match file creation events
  - type: event
    pattern: "file_create"

actions:
  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "^(?!\\.\\/\\.cursor\\/rules\\/.*\\.mdc$)"
        message: "Cursor rule files (.mdc) must be placed in the .cursor/rules directory"

  - type: suggest
    message: |
      When creating Cursor rules:

      1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         ├── another-rule.mdc
         └── ...
         ```

      2. Follow the naming convention:
         - Use kebab-case for filenames
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

      3. Directory structure:
         ```
         PROJECT_ROOT/
         ├── .cursor/
         │   └── rules/
         │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
         │       └── ...
         └── ...
         ```

      4. Never place rule files:
         - In the project root
         - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
         - In any other location

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Rule file in wrong location
      rules/my-rule.mdc
      my-rule.mdc
      .rules/my-rule.mdc

      # Good: Rule file in correct location
      .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc
    output: "Correctly placed Cursor rule file"

metadata:
  priority: high
  version: 1.0
</rule>
