# Skyborn Studios Website

This is the codebase for v1.0 of the Skyborn Studios website. The website itself serves as a point of reference for those interested in what we're doing and a way for us to document what we're working on. This codebase is currently open source as it is just basically a portfolio site with a blog attached, but will most likely be changed to be close source in the future.
